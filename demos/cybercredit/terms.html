        <p>Cyber Credit is a world class financial hub for community members around the globe to build trust and credit to do business with each other. Cyber Credit believes the ideal state of any economy, whether big or small, is the balance between centralization and decentralization. Too much of one or another will cause inefficiency in the economy. Centralization brings orders but lacks of freedom while decentralization provides more freedom and chaos. Cyber Credit Bureau is created based upon this simple concept. In regards to decentralization, this platform will enable users to vouch and rate any community member for their behavior of any financial transactions they make, whether through our P2P lending program or direct purchases of goods and services with our merchant networks. In regards to centralization, Cyber Credit Bureau will have a sophisticated credit rating system in place to verify each of our members to help them build a trustworthy profile. Once all the necessities have been met, each member will have their own credit score and provided with a Cyber Credit Bureau Visa/Master card.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to entrust people financially, and to make the world becomes better. Our vision is vividly clear and it fits into 3 categories: Community, Trust worthiness, Cyber Credit Bank (See White Paper).

        <h3>Disclosures</h3>
        <p>Virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), might not be legalized and they yet to be backed by your government.

You have to act on your own risk,</p>
        <p>Transactions in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are irreversible, and accidental transactions may not be recoverable. The volatility and unpredictability of the price of virtual currencies relative to the fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short periods of time. The Cyber Credit Coin and Cyber Credit Token are no different.</p>
        <p>Cyber Credit try to maximize the revenue for members by optimizing our volatility software and trading bot. However, there is still small chance that we make a loss because of technical or algorithm issues.</p>
        <p>Difficulties and and value of the crypto currency that we are mining are increasing over time. Mining is still showing profitable from time to time, however, there can be a sudden drop in asset value that we are holding.</p>
        <p>In lending, interest, income, and benefit are calculated in USD, the most stable fiat currency, not any other crypto currency. Members agree that they cannot terminate the contract before the Capital Back schedule. The daily profit is calculated as daily-basis; we can estimate in a price range, not a guaranteed number.</p>
        <p>Cyber Credit reserves the right to change to the lending interest, credit rating algorithm, and scoring system. Cyber Credit also reserves the right to apply new rules for lending.</p>
