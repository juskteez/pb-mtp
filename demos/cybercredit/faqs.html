              <h3>How does Cyber Credit rating system work?</h3>
              <p>The credit rating system works based on 3 main components:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Centralized KYC (know your clients) process: you will need to submit required documents such as IDs, proof of address,
                  banking verification etc. in order to get your KYC approved.</li>
                <li>P2P Vouching and Transaction Feedbacks: Cyber Credit uses a feedback system for each transaction you make on the
                  system. Your credit score will partly depend on your feedback score. Your known acquaintances can also vouch
                  for you to help you increase your credit score.</li>
                <li>Public Profile: you can link your account with pre-existing public profile such as Facebook, Twitter, Google +, etc.
                  to increase your creditability and credit score.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li class="content-section__item">
              <h3>When do I have to submit my KYC documents?</h3>
              <p>You are required to submit your required KYC documents before you make any withdrawal from Cyber Credit system except
                for the ‘guaranteed buy back’ refund withdrawal.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="content-section__item">
              <h3>How long does it take for my KYC to be approved?</h3>
              <p>Once your documents are fully submitted, it would take up to 10 business days for your KYC to be approved.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="content-section__item">
              <h3>What documents are required for my KYC approval?</h3>
              <p>The KYC process will be divided into smaller stages. Each stage will require a different document to be submitted. Please
                refer to the KYC tab in your back office for more information regarding required documents.</p>

              <h3>What is Bitcoin?</h3>
              <p>Bitcoin is the world´s very first digital decentralized cryptocurrency, created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. The system
                works without a central repository or single administrator which is categorized as decentralized. You can use them
                to make purchases around the world and convert them into your country’s currency, by using local or international
                exchanges. 24 hours a day 7 days a week.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="content-section__item">
              <h3>Why does Bitcoin have value?</h3>
              <p>Bitcoin has value because it has the characteristics of money (durability, portability, scarcity, divisibility, and recognizability) based
                on the properties of mathematics rather than relying on physical properties (gold and silver), or trust in central
                authorities (fiat currencies).</p>
              <p>With these attributes, all that is required for any type of currency to hold value is trust and adoption. In the case
                of Bitcoin, this can be measured by its growing demand of the users, merchants, and startups. Bitcoin's value comes
                only and directly from people willing to accept and use it as a payment.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="content-section__item">
              <h3>What determines Bitcoin price?</h3>
              <p>The price of a bitcoin is determined by supply and demand. When the demand for bitcoins increases, the price increases,
                and when the demand falls, the price falls. There is only a limited number of bitcoins in circulation and new bitcoins
                are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that demand must follow this level of inflation to
                keep the price stable. Because bitcoin is still a relatively small market compared to what it could be, it doesn't
                take significant amounts of money to move the market price up or down, and thus the price of a bitcoin is still very
                volatile.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="content-section__item">
              <h3>Is Bitcoin secure?</h3>
              <p>The Bitcoin technology, protocol and cryptography, has a strong security track record and public ledger (blockchain). The
                bitcoin network is probably the biggest distributed computing project in the world. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="content-section__item">
              <h3>Why do people trust Bitcoin?</h3>
              <p>Bitcoin is a fully decentralized (no intermediaries) open-source. Any developer in the world is able to verify exactly
                how bitcoin works. All existing transactions and the amount of bitcoins in circulation can be transparently consulted
                in real-time by anyone. All payments can be made without reliance on a third party and the whole system is protected
                by heavily peer-reviewed cryptographic algorithms like those used for online banking. No organization or individual
                can control bitcoin, therefore the network remains secure. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="content-section__item">
              <h3>Is it difficult to make payments using Bitcoin?</h3>
              <p>Making payments with bitcoins is easier than using debit or credit cards. It can be received even without a merchant
                account. Payments are made from a digital wallet application, either on your computer or smartphone.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="content-section__item">
              <h3>Can I make money with Bitcoin?</h3>
              <p>Bitcoin is a growing space of innovation and there are business opportunities that also include risks. Investing time
                and resources on anything related to Bitcoin requires entrepreneurship. There are various ways to make money with
                Bitcoin such as trading, mining, speculation or running new businesses, though all of these methods are competitive
                and there is no guarantee of profit. It is up to each individual to make a proper evaluation of the costs and the
                risks involved in any project.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="content-section__item">
              <h3>Is Bitcoin full virtual and Immaterial?</h3>
              <p>Bitcoin is as virtual as the credit cards and online banking networks people use everyday. Bitcoin can be used to pay
                online and in physical stores just like any other form of money. Bitcoins can also be exchanged in physical form,
                but paying with a mobile phone usually remains more convenient. Bitcoin balances are stored in a large distributed
                network, and they cannot be fraudulently altered by anybody. In other words, Bitcoin users have exclusive control
                over their funds and bitcoins cannot vanish just because they are virtual.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="content-section__item">
              <h3>Is the usage of Bitcoin confidential?</h3>
              <p>Bitcoin is designed to allow its users to send and receive payments with an acceptable level of privacy as well as any
                other currency. Though all bitcoin transactions are public (blockchain), the user´s confidential information remains
                private as long as no centralized institution gets involved.</p>
              <p>Some concerns have been raised that private transactions could be used for illegal purposes with Bitcoin. However, it
                is worth taking into consideration that Bitcoin will definitely be subjected to similar regulations that are already
                current in some financial systems; this means it will not prevent criminal investigations from being conducted.</p>

              <h3>Is Bitcoin legal?</h3>
              <p>To the best of our knowledge, bitcoin has not been made illegal by legislation in most jurisdictions. However, some jurisdictions
                (such as Argentina and Russia) severely restrict or ban foreign currencies. Other jurisdictions (such as Thailand)
                may limit the licensing of certain entities such as Bitcoin exchanges.</p>
              <p>Regulators from various jurisdictions are taking steps to provide individuals and businesses with rules on how to integrate
                this new technology with the formal, regulated financial system. For example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
                (FinCEN), a bureau in the United States Treasury Department, issued non-binding guidance on how it characterizes
                certain activities involving virtual currencies.</p>

            <li class="content-section__item">
              <h3>Can Bitcoin be used for illegal purposes?</h3>
              <p>Bitcoin is money, and money has always been used both for legal and illegal purposes. Cash, credit cards and current
                banking systems widely surpass Bitcoin in terms of their use to finance crime. Bitcoin can bring significant innovation
                in payment systems and the benefits of such innovation are often considered to be far beyond their potential drawbacks.</p>
              <p>Bitcoin is designed to be a huge step forward in making money more secure and could also act as a significant protection
                against many forms of financial crime. For instance, bitcoins are completely impossible to counterfeit. Users are
                in full control of their payments and cannot receive unapproved charges such as with credit card fraud. Bitcoin transactions
                are irreversible and immune to fraudulent chargebacks. Bitcoin prevents against theft and loss using very strong
                and useful mechanisms such as backups, encryption, and multiple signatures.</p>
              <p>Some concerns have been raised that Bitcoin could be more attractive to criminals because it can be used to make private
                and irreversible payments. However, these features already exist with cash and wire transfer, which are widely used
                and well-established. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="content-section__item">
              <h3>Can Bitcoin be regulated?</h3>
              <p>The Bitcoin protocol itself cannot be modified without the cooperation of all its users, who choose what software to
                use. Attempting to assign special rights to a local authority in the rules of the global Bitcoin network is not a
                possibility. Any organization could choose to invest in mining hardware to control half of the computing power of
                the network and become able to block or reverse recent transactions. However, there is no guarantee that they could
                mantain control since this requires to invest as much as all other miners in the world.</p>
              <p>It is however possible to regulate the usage of Bitcoin in a similar way to any other currency, just like the dollar. Bitcoin
                can be used for a wide variety of purposes, some of which can be considered legitimate or not as per each jurisdiction's
                laws. Therefore, Bitcoin is no different than any other currency or resource and can be subjected to different regulations
                in each country. Bitcoin´s use could also be made difficult by restrictive regulations; in this case it is hard to
                determine what percentage of users would keep using the technology. A government that chooses to ban Bitcoin would
                prevent domestic businesses and markets from developing, shifting innovation to other countries. The challenge for
                regulators is to develop efficient solutions while not impairing the growth of new emerging markets and businesses.</p>

            <li class="content-section__item">
              <h3>What about Bitcoin and Taxes?</h3>
              <p>Bitcoin is not a fiat currency with legal tender status in any jurisdiction, but often tax liability accrues regardless
                of the medium used. There is a wide variety of legislation in many different jurisdictions which could cause income,
                sales, payroll, capital gains, or some other form of tax liability to arise with Bitcoin.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="content-section__item">
              <h3>What about Bitcoin and consumer protection?</h3>
              <p>Bitcoin is freeing people to transact on their own terms. Each user can send and receive payments in a similar way to
                cash but they can also take part in more complex contracts. Multiple signatures allow a transaction to be accepted
                by the network only if a certain number of a defined group of persons agree to sign the transaction. This allows
                innovative dispute mediation services to be developed in the future. Such services could allow a third party to approve
                or reject a transaction in case of disagreement between the other parties without having control on their money.
                As opposed to cash and other payment methods, Bitcoin always leaves a public proof that a transaction did take place,
                which can potentially be used in a recourse against businesses with fraudulent practices.</p>
              <p>It is also worth to mention that while merchants usually depend on their public reputation to remain in business and
                pay their employees, they don't have access to the same level of information when dealing with new consumers. The
                way Bitcoin works allows both individuals and businesses to be protected against fraudulent chargebacks while giving
                the choice to the consumer to ask for more protection when they are not willing to trust a particular merchant.</p>
